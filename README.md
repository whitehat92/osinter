Some really great developers that I want to thank for helping me improve my poor skills on python and also for letting the commmunity know what's available on the internet:
Somdev Sangwan https://github.com/s0md3v
Nahamsec https://github.com/nahamsec
If I forgot to mention anyone that also originally wrote a code on this script, please DM and I sincerely apologize for that.

This code is full of bugs (A lot really), but as I'm starting this process, I decided to put publically this project just in case someone wants at least to know which public repositories are available to search information.
There are a lot of resources available online, but I just wanted to gather everything in one place. That's all

Anyway, a few features:
- you can put literally everything in the input and it will crawl a bunch of online databases
- In the final, if you selected "n" on google dorks, saying you don't want to use google dorks, and also if you don't want to open automatically your browser for most databases, it will generate a latex document and from there you can generate a pdf.
